# Utlilizing Parallalization to Reduce Encryption Time
# Python applications using MPI to perform AES encryption on text files

# Problem set is to use parallel processing (OpenMPI) and the cloud to encrypt text files to simlulate large scale encryption on a single CPU, point-to-point MPI communication, and MPI Scatter communication to multiple nodes.   Use OpenMPI to encrypted plaintext using AES on node or cluster. 

# Tools - Python Cryptography toolkit; OpenMPI, OpenStack, Google Cloud Platform
